\section*{Mooving Cow}
Bessie the Cow is $5$ meters north of Farmer John's house.
She starts running east at $2$ meters per second.
After how many seconds will she be exactly $10$ meters away from Farmer John's house?
Express your answer in exact form.

Bessie the Cow found the following right triangle $ABC$.
The distance from point $A$ to point $B$ is $7$, and the distance from point $A$ to point $C$ is $10$.
$\angle A$ is a right angle, and $\overline{AX}$ is the altitude from point $A$ to side $\overline{BC}$.
What is the length of this altitude (the distance from point $A$ to point $X$)?
Express your answer in exact form.

\section*{Mooish}
Farmer Paul has two types of cows: truthy cows and falsy cows.
Physically, they are indistinguishable.
They all speak mooish, and they can be distinguished by how they answer questions.
The truthy cows always reply truthfully, and the falsy cows always lie.
Bessie had a conversation with three of Farmer Paul's cows: Annabelle, Betsie, and Cornelius.
Here's a translation of the conversation.
\begin{displayquote}
	Bessie: Annabelle, is Betsie truthy or falsy? \\
	Annabelle: Falsy \\
	Bessie: Betsie, are the types of Annabelle and Cornelius different? \\
	Betsie: No. \\
	Bessie: Talkative lot, aren't they? Cornelius, is Betsie truthy or falsy? \\
	Cornelius: Truthy.
\end{displayquote}
What is the type of each cow?

\section*{Green Cows}
Help Bessie the Cow answer the question ``How much grass can a green cow chow if green cows can chow grass?''
Bessie and Elsie both chow grass at constant rates.
If Bessie can chow all the grass in a field in $3$ hours and Elsie can chow all the grass in the same field in $4$ minutes, how long will it take for them to chow all the grass in this field together?
Express your answer in exact form.
