    \begin{enumerate}
        \item What is the remainder when the absolute difference between $4 \cdot 199$ and $7 \cdot 219$ is divided by $3$?

        \item What fraction of positive integer factors of $1000^3$ are perfect squares?
            Express your answer as a common fraction.

        \item What is the smallest possible integer multiple of $130$ that is divisible by $365$?

        \item When the three-digit number $ABC$ is multiplied by $9$, the result is the four-digit number $1ABC$.
            What is the three-digit number $ABC$?

        \item Chase Coutinho has $p$ pennies, $n$ nickels, $d$ dimes and $q$ quarters with a total value of $\$1.08$.
            If the numbers $p$, $n$, $d$ and $q$ are distinct and positive, and the greatest common divisor of each pair of these numbers is $1$, what is the least possible value of $p + n + d + q$?
