    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In parallelogram $ABCD$, diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $E$.
            If $AE = 2x + 9$ and $CE = 5x$, what is the length of diagonal $AC$?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item What is the interior angle measure of a regular $15$-gon?
            Solve using two methods.
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item What is the area of a triangle with integer side lengths and a perimeter of $8$ cm?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item What is the smallest angle which can be created by connecting three vertices of a regular $36$-gon?
            \vspace{3cm}
        \item In isosceles triangle $ABC$, $m\angle A = \ang{96}$.
            What is the $m\angle B$?
