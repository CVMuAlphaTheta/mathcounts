        \item A polygon has $11$ sides and $10$ congruent $\ang{150}$ interior angles.
            What is the measure of its largest exterior angle?

        \item In parallelogram $ABCD$, diagonal $AC$ is twice the length of diagonal $BD$.
            The perimeter of triangle $ABC$ is $21$ cm and the perimeter of triangle $BCD$ is $17$ cm.
            What is the perimeter of parallelogram $ABCD$?
