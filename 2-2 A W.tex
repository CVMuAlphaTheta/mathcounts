\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise 
specified. Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In how many ways can the letters $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ be 
        arranged so that no letter is adjacent to any letter that comes 
        immediately before it or immediately after it alphabetically?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item If there are $3$ boys and $4$ girls in a group and two are chosen 
        to give a report, what is the probability that one boy and one girl 
        are chosen?

    \item Cedric has four times as many shirts and pants, and he can use 
        them to make $100$ different shirt-and-pants outfits. How many pants 
        does Cedric have?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many rectangles (of any size) are there in this figure?
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw (0, 0) -- (6, 0) -- (6, 2) -- (0, 2) -- cycle;
                \draw (0, 1) -- (6, 1);
                \draw (2, 0) -- (2, 2);
                \draw (4, 0) -- (4, 2);
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}

    \item Every student who applied for admission to a veterinary school has 
        at least one pet: $30$ have a cat, $28$ have a dog, and $26$ have 
        fish. If $13$ students have a fish and a cat, $15$ students have 
        fish and a dog, $11$ students have both a cat and a dog, and $4$ 
        students have a cat, a dog, and a fish, how many students applied to 
        veterinary school? Hint: Use this Venn diagram.
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw (90 : 1.5) circle (2);
                \node[above] at (90 : 3.5) {Cat};
                \draw (210 : 1.5) circle (2);
                \node[below left] at (210 : 3.5) {Dog};
                \draw (330 : 1.5) circle (2);
                \node[below right] at (330 : 3.5) {Fish};
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        \vspace{3cm}
\end{enumerate}
