    \noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise spceified.
    Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Twenty-five students have a combiend average of $84$ on a test,
        while another group of twenty students have a combined average of $66$.
        Find the overall average.
        \begin{solution}
            The first group's scores have sum $25 \cdot 84 = 2100$, while the second
            grop's scores have sum $20 \cdot 66 = 1320$. Thus, the $45$ scores have sum
            $2100 + 1320 = 3420$, so the average, is $\frac{3420}{45} = 76$.
        \end{solution}
        \item Three six-sided dice are rolled. What is the probability that at least one
        comes up with a $5$ or a $6$?
        \begin{solution}
            Consider the probability that none of them come up with a $5$ or a $6$. That
            would be $\frac{4}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{6} \cdot \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{27}$. The
            probability that at least one comes up with a $5$ or a $6$ would be
            $1 - \frac{8}{27} = \frac{19}{27}$.
        \end{solution}
        \item There is a $20\%$ chance it will rain today. If it rains, there is a $10\%$
        chance that we will be allowed to go outside; otherwise, there is an $80\%$ chance
        we will be able to go outside. What is the probability that we will be able to
        go outside?
        \begin{solution}
            We split this into the case that it rains and the case that it doesn't. The
            probability that it rains and we go outside is $0.20 \times 0.10 = 0.02$.
            The probability that it doesn't rain and we go outside is $(1 - 0.2) \times 0.80 = 0.64$.
            The overall probability that we go outside is then the sum of these,
            or $0.64 + 0.02 = 0.66$.
        \end{solution}
        \item What is the probability of getting exactly $6$ correct answers on a
        10-question true-false test by randomly guessing? Express your answer as a common fraction.
        \begin{solution}
            Each of the 10 questions will either be true or false, so there are $2 ^ {10} = 1024$ possible
            combinations of answers for the test. There are ``10 choose 6" or
            $_{10}C_6 = \frac{10!}{4!6!} = \frac{10\cdot9\cdot8\cdot7}{4\cdot3\cdot2\cdot1} = 10\cdot3\cdot7 = 210$
            ways to get exactly $6$ correct answers. So, the proabbility is $\frac{210}{1024} = \frac{105}{512}$.
        \end{solution}
        \item This stem-and-lead plot shows the heights of the basketball players at East High School.
        If $6 | 8$ represents $68$ inches, what is the average height of the basketball players
        at East High School?\\
        $6 | 8, 8, 9, 9 \\ 7 | 1, 2, 7, 7, 8, 8 \\ 8 | 0, 1$
        \begin{solution}
            For the average height, we compute the arithmetic mean by adding up all the heights
            and diving by the number of heights. The sum of the players' heights is
            $68 + 68 + 69 + 69+ 71 + 72 + 77 + 77 +78 +78 +80 + 81 = 888$. The average height
            is $888 \div 12 = 74$ inches.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}
