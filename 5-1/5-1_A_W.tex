    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Happy Trails Cycles have a collection of unicycles, bicycles, and tricycles in stock, with at least one of each item in inventory.
            If there are a total of $73$ wheels on the collection of unicycles, bicycles, and tricycles, what is the maximum possible number of bicycles in the shop's inventory?

        \item Ali's middle school has a total of $300$ students on Team A and Team B.
            After $30$ students are moved from Team A to Team B, there are twice as many students on Team A as there are on Team B.
            How many students were originally on Team B?

        \item Marco's age is between $20$ and $60$.
            The square of his age is a four-digit number, and the sum of the digits of his age is $8$.
            How old is Marco if his age has two different digits and is not prime?

        \item Nya starts with an integer $N$ and repeatedly subtracts $6$.
            Mya starts with an integer $M$ and repeatedly adds $8$.
            When Nya and Mya have each performed their respective operation $13$ times, both have a resulting value of $25$.
            What is the value of $N + M$?

        \item Andrew mowed one-half of a lawn, and Ben mowed one-third of the same lawn, each at a constant rate.
            If Andrew, continuing at the same rate, finished mowing the rest of the lawn in $12$ minutes, how many minutes would it have taken to mow the entire lawn by himself?
