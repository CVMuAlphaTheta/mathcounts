    \noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
    Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In how many different ways can a student guess a complete set of answers to a
        five-item true/false quiz?

        \item How many ways can $5$ books be arranged on a shelf if $2$ of the books must
        remain together?

        \item If $n = 100$, find the value of $\frac{(n+1)!}{(n-1)!}$

        \item Andrew and Lindsey are seated at a round table with four other people. If everyone
        is randomly seated, what is the probability that Andrew and Lindsey are seated next to
        each other? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        \item What is the probability of getting exactly $6$ correctly answers on a 10-question
        true-false test by randomly guessing? Express your answer as a common fraction.
