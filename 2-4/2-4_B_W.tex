    \noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
    Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Andrew and Lindsey are seated at a round table with four other people. If
        everyone is randomly seated, what is the probability that Andrew and Lindsey are
        seated next to each other? Express your answer as a common fraction.

        \item In how many ways can Antoinette give one M\&M each to two children. If she has 
        $3$ different red, $4$ different brown, and $5$ different tan ones and two children 
        insist upon having M\&Ms of different colors?

        \item Palindromes, like $23432$, read the same forward and backward. Find the sum of 
        all four digit positive integer palindromes. (Hint: What is the sum of the first and 
        last four digit palindrome added together?)

        \item How many of the arrangements of the letters in the word COUNTING contain a
        double-N?

        \item The $54$-member Council for Security and Cooperation in Europe wishes to 
        choose $3$ member states for different leadership positions. The L lobby decrees that 
        at least one of Lithuania, Lichtenstein, Latvia, and Luxembourg must be chosen. In 
        how many ways can the committee be selected?
