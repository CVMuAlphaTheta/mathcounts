\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise 
specified. Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item In how many ways can a five letter ``word'' be written using only 
        the first half of the alphabet with no repetitions such that the 
        third and fifth letters are vowels and the first letter is a 
        consonant?

    \item At the end of a professional bowling tournament, the top $5$ bowlers have a 
        playoff. First \#$5$ bowls \#$4$. The loser receives fifth prize and the winner 
        bowls \#$3$ in another game. The loser of this game receives fourth prize and the 
        winner bowls \#$2$. The loser of this game receives third prize and the winner bowls 
        \#$1$. The winner of this game gets first prize and the loser gets second prize. 
        In how many orders can bowlers \#$1$ through \#$5$ receive the prizes.

    \item In how many ways can the letters in the word MINIMIZATION be arranged 
        such that no two vowels are consecutive?

    \item In how many ways can $4$ identical red chips and $2$ identical white chips be 
        arranged in a circle?
