    \noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
    Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item How many factors of $2^{95}$ are there which are greater than $1000000$?
        \vspace{3cm}
        \item What is the units digit of the sum $1! + 2! + 3! + \dots + 14! + 15!$?
        \vspace{3cm}
        \item Numbers that read the same forward and backward are called palindromes. How many
        three-digit numbers are palindromes?
        \pagebreak
        \item What is the value of the expression $\frac{8! - 7 \cdot 7! + 6 \cdot 6!}
        {7! - 6 \cdot 6! + 5 \cdot 5!}$? Express your answer as a common fraction.
