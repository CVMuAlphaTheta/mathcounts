\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise
specified. Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The greatest common factor of $42$ and $24$ is $m$. What is the least
        common multiple of $m$ and $15$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many odd numbers are factors of $240$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many even numbers are factors of $240$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item What is the sum of the distinct prime factors of $156$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Let $A = 1$, $B = 2$, $C = 3$, and so on. Call the product value of a word
        the product of its letter values. For example, the product value of CAT is
        $3 \cdot 1 \cdot 20 = 60$. The name of which state in the U.S. has a product
        value of $3105$?
