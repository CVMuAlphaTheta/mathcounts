\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The greatest common factor of $42$ and $24$ is $m$.
        What is the least common multiple of $m$ and $15$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many even numbers are factors of $240$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Let $A = 1$, $B = 2$, $C = 3$, and so on.
        Call the product value of a word the product of its letter values.
        For example, the product value of CAT is $3 \cdot 1 \cdot 20 = 60$.
        The name of which state in the US has a product value of $3105$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many divisors of $3240$ are perfect squares?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item How many positive divisors of $30!$ are prime?
        \vspace{3cm}
