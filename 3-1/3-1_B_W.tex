\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise
specified. Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by
    $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, and $10$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Using only $1$'s and $2$'s, what is the smallest integer you can create
        which is divisible by both $3$ and $8$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Each of the digits $0$ through $9$ is used exactly once to create a ten-digit
        integer. Find the greatest ten-digit number which uses each digit once and is
        divisible by $8, 9, 10, \textrm{and } 11$.
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item What is the sum of the unique prime factors of $9991$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item What is the largest prime factor $8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 -
        6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$?
