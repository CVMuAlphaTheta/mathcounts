\noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the smallest four-digit number that is divisible by $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, and $10$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Using only $1$'s and $2$'s, what is the smallest integer you can create which is divisible by both $3$ and $8$?
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Each of the digits $0$ through $9$ is used exactly once to create a ten-digit integer.
        Find the greatest ten-digit number which uses each digit once and is divisible by $8$, $9$, $10$, and $11$.
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item If a $5$ digit number $5DDDD$ is divisible by $6$, then find the digit $D$.
        \vspace{3cm}
    \item Find the product of the GCD and LCM of $100$ and $120$.
