    \noindent Problems should be solved without calculators unless otherwise specified.
    Remember to explain how you solved a problem.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In how many ways can the letters A, B, C, and D be arranged so that no letter is
        adjacent to any letter that comes immediately before it or immediately after it alphabetically?
        \begin{solution}
            When arranged alphabetically, the letters B and C are each beside two other letters.
            In order for B and C not to be beside those letters, B can only be next to D,
            and C can only be next to A. That means B and C must be on the ends, with A and D
            in between them. There are exactly 2 arrangements that meet these conditions:
            BDAC and CADB.
        \end{solution}
        \item If there are 3 boys and 4 girls in a group and two are chosen to give a report,
        what is the probability that one boy and one girl are chosen?
        \begin{solution}
            There are $3 \cdot 4 = 12$ different girl-boy partnerships possible. In total,
            there are $7 \cdot 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 21$ different partnerships possible.
            The probability is $\frac{12}{21}$.
        \end{solution}
        \item Cedric has four times as many shirts and pants, and he can use them to make
        100 different shirt-and-pants outfits. How many pants does Cedric have?
        \begin{solution}
            If Cedric has $s$ shirts and $p$ pants, then, according to the Fundamental Counting
            Principle, he can make $s \times p$ outfits. Since Cederic has four times as many
            shirts as pants, we have the equation $4p \times p = 100$. At this point, if we
            recognize that we are looking for two factors of 100 where one factor is four times
            the other, we might realize those factors are 20 and 5. If, on the other hand we
            do not make that observation, we can just solve for the equation $4p^2 = 100$ for $p$.
            Doing so, we get $p^2 = 25$, and $p = 5$. So, Cedric has 5 pants.
        \end{solution}

        \item How many rectangles (of any size) are there in this figure?
        \begin{center}
            \begin{tikzpicture}
                \draw (0, 0) -- (2, 0) -- (2, 1) -- (0, 1) -- cycle;
                \draw (0, 1) -- (2, 1) -- (2, 2) -- (0, 2) -- cycle;
                \draw (2, 0) -- (4, 0) -- (4, 1) -- (2, 1) -- cycle;
                \draw (2, 1) -- (4, 1) -- (4, 2) -- (2, 2) -- cycle;
                \draw (4, 0) -- (6, 0) -- (6, 1) -- (4, 1) -- cycle;
                \draw (4, 1) -- (6, 1) -- (6, 2) -- (4, 2) -- cycle;
            \end{tikzpicture}
        \end{center}
        \begin{solution}
            There are a total of 18 rectangles.
        \end{solution}
        \item Every student who applied for admission to a veterinary school has at least one
        pet: 30 have a cat, 28 have a dog, and 26 have fish. If 13 students have a fish and a
        cat, 15 students have fish and a dog, 11 students have both a cat and a dog, and 4
        students have a cat, a dog, and a fish, how many students applied to veterinary school?
        \begin{solution}
            30 cat-owners + 28 dog-owners + 26 fish-owners = 84 owners. Students who own two
            (or more) different animals were counted multiple times, so we subtract them:
            $84 - 13 - 15 - 11 = 45$. When we subtracted students with two pets, we subtracted
            the students who have all three pets three times when we wanted to subtract them twice.
            Add these four students back to get $49$.
        \end{solution}
    \end{enumerate}
